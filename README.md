# Reflection

1. Create an @AutoInjectable annotation


2. Understand the Properties class


3. Create an Injector class in which there would be a parameterized inject method that would take an object of any class as a parameter and, using reflection mechanisms, search for fields marked with this annotation (a certain interface is used as a field type), and would initialize these fields with instances of classes that are specified as the implementation of the corresponding interface in some settings file (properites)
